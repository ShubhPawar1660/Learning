GitHub Learning 
-------------------------------------------------
 *Git is distributed version system control(you can clone actual resposeotry and work on it.)
 *in Git things are stored in snapshot.
    Example:-- 
            1. This is the TEST ---> Snapshot 1
			2. This is new TEST ---> Snapshot 2 
	!!!Simply we can say Take snapshot (commit)and take new snapshot again.!!!
